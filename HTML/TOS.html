		<h3><span lang="DA">Do I have to grant any licenses to Company or to other users?</h3>
		<span lang="DA">Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission.”  Some User Submissions are viewable by other users.  In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions.  Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy (<a href="http://www.enovawellness.com/privacy">www.enovawellness.com/privacy</a>) to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information. <br><br>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Company a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below.  This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.<br><br>If you store a User Submission in your own personal Company account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant Company the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.

		<h3><span lang="DA">What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</h3>
		<span lang="DA">You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like Company, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright.  We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers. To learn more about the DMCA, click <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">here</a>. In accordance with the DMCA, we’ve adopted the policy below toward copyright infringement.<br>(1)	Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements.  If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Company’s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our “Designated Agent,” whose contact details are listed below):<br>(a)	A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;<br>(b)	Identification of works or materials being infringed;<br>
	(c)	Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Company is capable of finding and verifying its existence;<br>
	(d)	Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;<br>
	(e)	A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (1)(c) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and<br>
	(f)	A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.<br><br>
	(2)	Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent.  Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:<br>
	(a)	remove or disable access to the infringing material;<br>
	(b)	notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and<br>
	(c)	terminate such content provider's access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.<br><br>(3)	Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent.  If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:<br>

	(a)	A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;<br>
	(b)	Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;<br>
	(c)	A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and<br>
	(d)	Content provider's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s address is located, or, if the content provider's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company's discretion.<br><br>

Please contact Company's Designated Agent at the following address:
